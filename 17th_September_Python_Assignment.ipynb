    "\n",
    "A for loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) or any iterable object.\n",
    "\n",
    "It iterates over a predefined range or sequence of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop iterates through each element in the sequence and executes the code block associated with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop terminates when it has iterated through all elements in the sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "for loops are used when the number of iterations is known or predefined (e.g., iterating through elements of a list).\n",
    "\n",
    "**While Loop:**\n",
    "\n",
    "A while loop in Python repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "It doesnâ€™t require a predefined iteration of elements; instead, it depends on the truthfulness of a condition.\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop continues executing as long as the condition remains true.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to ensure that the condition inside the while loop has a mechanism to eventually become false, otherwise, the loop will run indefinitely (known as an infinite loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "while loops are used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand, and the loop continues as long as a certain condition is true."

    "We are defining a function named \"is_perfect_square\" that takes one parameter number.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the function, \"square_root = number ** 0.5\" calculates the square root of the given number by raising it to the power of 0.5.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"if square_root.is_integer()\" statement checks if the calculated square root is an integer using the is_integer() method. If the square root is an integer, it means that the number is a perfect square.\n",
    "\n",
    "the function \"is_perfect_square\" return True if the condition in the if statement is true (i.e., the square root is an integer).\n",
    "\n",
    "else if the condition in the above if statement is false (i.e., the square root is not an integer), \"else\" block of the code is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "the function \"is_perfect_square\" return False if the condition in the above if statement is false .\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are asking the user to enter a number through the console and We accept it as a float to handle both integer and decimal input.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then the if-else block that follows the input statement uses the is_perfect_square(num) function to determine if the input num is a perfect square or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, it prints a message indicating whether the input number is a perfect square or not based on the function's return value."

Functions can return values using the return statement.\n",

    "Following are the Best practices for naming functions and variables in python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use lowercase letters and underscores to separate words (snake_case). Use descriptive names that convey the purpose of the function or the data stored in the variable. Example: \"calculate_square_area()\", \"user_age = 25\".\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use meaningful names that describe the purpose or intent of the function or variable. Avoid single-letter or ambiguous names (unless they're conventional in the context, like i for loop iterators).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Maintain consistency in naming across your codebase. Use the same style and format for similar entities (functions, variables) to enhance readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Avoid using Python reserved keywords (e.g., def, for, while, class, if, else) as function or variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. For functions that perform actions or operations, use verbs to indicate the action being taken. Example: \"calculate\", \"validate\".\n",
    "\n",
    "6. If using abbreviations, ensure they are widely understood and intuitive. Avoid overly cryptic abbreviations that may confuse others reading the code. Example: \"max_len\", \"num_iter\".\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Stick to the guidelines outlined in PEP 8, Python's style guide, for naming conventions and code readability."
