    "\n",
    "For n > 1, it performs three recursive steps; Moves the top (n-1) disks from the source rod to the auxiliary rod using the destination rod as an auxiliary. Then prints the move of the nth disk from the source rod to the destination rod. Then moves the remaining (n-1) disks from the auxiliary rod to the destination rod using the source rod as an auxiliary.\n",

    "In the driver code, num_disks is set to 3, and the tower_of_hanoi function is called with num_disks, starting from rod 'A' as the source, rod 'C' as the destination, and rod 'B' as the auxiliary.\n",
