It Returns True if the given year is a leap year, otherwise, it returns False.\n",

It Uses the information about leap years obtained from the is_leap_year() function. If the month number is 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, or 12, it returns 31 days. If the month number is 4, 6, 9, or 11, it returns 30 days. For February (month number 2), it checks if the given year is a leap year using is_leap_year(). If it is, February has 29 days, otherwise, it has 28 days.\n",

It excludes the first (smallest) and last (largest) elements using list slicing ([1:length-1]). The sorted list removes the smallest and largest values from consideration for calculating the average. It then Calculates the sum of elements in the sorted list (sum(sorted_lst)) and divides it by the length of the original list to obtain the average (avg=sum(sorted_lst)/length). Then Returns the calculated average.\n",

    "Function \"initialize_deck()\" Creates and shuffles a standard deck of 52 playing cards using ranks (from '2' to 'A') and suits ('Hearts', 'Diamonds', 'Clubs', 'Spades').\n",
    "\n",
    "Finction \"calculate_hand_value(hand)\" Calculates the total value of a hand in blackjack. Assigns a value to each card, numeric cards have their face value, face cards ('J', 'Q', 'K') are worth 10, and 'A' is initially counted as 11. It adjusts 'A' to 1 if the total value exceeds 21.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function \"display_hand(hand, player_name)\" prints the cards in a player's or dealer's hand and their total value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Function \"play_blackjack()\" initiates the blackjack game. Deals two cards each to the player and the dealer. Displays the player's hand and one card of the dealer's hand. Manages the player's turn, allowing the player to hit or stand.\n",
    "Initiates the dealer's turn after the player's decision. Determines the winner or tie based on the final values of the player's and dealer's hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "The game follows standard blackjack rules, The player aims for a total value close to 21 without exceeding it.\n",
    "The dealer stands on a total value of 17 or higher. The game declares a win if the player's total value is higher than the dealer's without exceeding 21, or if the dealer busts (exceeds 21). It considers a tie if both the player and dealer have the same total value.  Players can choose to hit (receive an additional card) or stand (end their turn) until they reach a satisfactory total or bust."
